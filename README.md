# The Producer-Consumer problem

This application animates a multiple buffer solution to the classic Producer-Consumer problem in Computer Science. The system was built as part of the dissertation project while studying for an MSc in Computer Science from Newcastle University.

The application was developed to be used as a teaching tool to assist students in understanding how mutual exclusion synchronisation and condition synchronisation can be used to control threads accessing a shared resource. The system used both techniques in solving the Producer-Consumer problem as well as simulating the techniques in a GUI. The two forms of synchronisation were implemented using Java's built in Monitor. A Monitor consists of a single lock and provides methods that allow threads to communicate and wait for a certain condition before being allowed to continue, or to signal to other threads that a condition may now be met.

Features:

Use of Java Monitor in achieving thread synchronisation.
Use of Java Swing framework to provide the GUI
Understanding of the Java-Memory-Model
