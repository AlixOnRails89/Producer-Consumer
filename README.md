# Producer-Consumer

This is a graphical animation of the Producer-Consumer problem.

Project completed while studying for MSc Computer Science from Newcastle University.

The project is a collection of classes that could be used for the development of a Car Rental System application. The project demonstrates the developers understanding of object oriented programming and the ability to build and test simple algorithms. Each class within the project was refactored according to the rules of clean code.

TDD life-cycle was used in the development of the project to ensure every method was accurate. This was achieved using JUnit testing framework. The Builder Pattern was used to construct the objects for the Unit Tests. Each test class was developed and improved to achieve the highest possible code coverage using EclEmma the Java code coverage tool for eclipse. Using EclEmma the result of the coverage session is directly visible in the Java source code highlighting the areas of code which were executed or not executed. The developer used this feature to test specific areas within each method ensuring each algorithm functioned accurately for different input values.

Features:

Use of static factory methods.
Defensive program techniques - ensuring incorrect values don't enter the system.
Developing simple testable methods.
Combining methods to produce simple algorithms.
Readble Code.
